==============================
JUMP, DUCK, DO ANYTHING: v0.1
==============================
This is a small project I made in Uni which was my first ever 'multiplayer' game. I would like to follow up with this concept or project a little down the line because I enjoy the chaos of games like this with friends.

SUMMARY:
Best played with either two or three people. Just an endless runner type game except its coop reliant because your controls don't always control your character, your up might be player 2's jump while player 3's down controls your duck.

HOW TO PLAY:
In menu: 1, 2, 3 to choose amount of players. Player 1 uses the UP and DOWN arrow keys, player 2 uses ENTER and RIGHT SHIFT, Player 3 uses PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN. This is so that all the controls are smooshed together on one side of the keyboard. Once you've chosen your number of players and have figured out the controls, use SPACE to start (escape key allows you to exit game).

1, 2, 3 for player choice
Player 1: UP and DOWN
Player 2: ENTER and RIGHT SHIFT
Player 3: PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN
SPACE to start

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Fix some bugs
- Fiddle around with the balancing
- Better UI
- Aesthetic theming
- More players
- Online Coop?
